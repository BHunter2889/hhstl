## Step 1: Create React App

First, you want to make sure that you have Node >= 6 and create-react-app on your local development machine.

Once you have these, you can execute the command the init your new react app!
```
>create-react-app mern-bootstrap
```

Once this finishes without error, open the new mern-bootstrap directory in terminal and start up your new app by running 'npm start'
```
>cd mern-bootstrap
>npm start
```
